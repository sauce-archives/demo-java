> NOTE: this feature is **NOT** supported for emulators and simulators!!

## Important information
### Environment variables for Sauce Labs
The examples in this repository that can run on Sauce Labs use environment variables, make sure you've added the following

    # For Sauce Labs Real devices in the New UI
    export SAUCE_USERNAME=********
    export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=*******
    
### Demo app(s)
The demo app that has been used for all these tests can be found [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases).
Be aware of the fact that you need the build for the iOS real device. So please check the file you download.

> The advice is to download the files to an `apps` folder in the root of this folder.

### Upload apps to Sauce Storage
* If you want to use iOS real devices and Android real devices in the New Sauce Labs UI you need to upload the apps to the Sauce Storage.
For more information on this step please visit: [Application Storage](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Application+Storage).
* In the app capability you can use storage:filename=<file-name>. For more information on this step please visit: [Using Application Storage with Automated Test Builds](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Application+Storage#ApplicationStorage-UsingApplicationStoragewithAutomatedTestBuilds) section of [Application Storage](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Application+Storage)
